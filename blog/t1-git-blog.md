As a programmer, when you are given a feature to build out, there are usually multiple ways to arrive at that solution. Sometimes, you have no idea what you are doing, and you would create a version just to experiment. Overtime, your project may become increasingly complex and large, and soon you'll face a few of these problems that all developers face.

    1. Keeping track of multiple versions of the code becomes difficult
    2. Remembering which modification was made to which version is almost impossible
    3. You modified an important piece of code from the inccorect version, and you are having a difficult time reverting your changes.

This is where version control systems really shine! At it's core, version control systems provide the ability to keep track of changes of all of your files, over time. As you create different version of your code, it is all recorded by the system. You can easily switch between your current version and earlier versions. And when you realize that you've made a mistake, all you have to do is find your way back to the previous version.

Git, a version control system, keeps track of your changes by `commits`. A commit is a snapshot of your project at it's current state. It captures all the newest changes you've made to your project and adds it to the history of all commits. Now whenever you've made a change to your project, and committed it, you have a photo album of sorts that you can look back to. So if you want to find a specific version of your project from the past, you just have to locate it in your chain of snapshots. 

GitHub is an online platform that hosts these projects we have placed under version control. While one aspect of GitHub's service is to host all of these respositories, the main value of GitHub is that it helps developers collaborate more easily. As a developer, GitHub is a great place to look for open source projects to contribute to. GitHub provides great features such as pull requests, bug issue filing and many more that really help teams develop in a more collaborative manner.
