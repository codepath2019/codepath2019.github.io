As a programmer, when you are given a feature to build out, there are usually multiple ways to arrive at that solution. Sometimes, you have no idea what you are doing, and you would create a version just to experiment. Overtime, your project may become increasingly complex and large, and soon you'll face a few of these problems that all developers face.

    1. You don't know how to keep track of all the versions of your project
    2. You don't know how to keep track of all the changes you've made to your project
    3. You accidentally introduced a bug into your project, and you don't have a way of reverting back to the previous state

This is where version control systems really shine! At it's core, version control systems provide the ability to keep track of changes of all of your files, over time. As you create different versions of your code, it is all recorded by the system. You can easily switch between your current version and earlier versions. And when you realize that you've made a mistake, all you have to do is find your way back to the previous version.

Git, a version control system, keeps track of your changes by `commits`. A commit is a snapshot of your project at it's current state. It captures all the newest changes you've made to your project and adds it to the history of all commits. And overtime, you will be able to refer to this history of commits to find out when and where you changed which file and why. So if you want to find a specific version of your project from the past, you just have to locate it in your chain of snapshots. And if you want to restart your project from there, you just check out that project version and begin working on it as if you just magically travelled back in time to when you first saved that version.

GitHub is an online platform that hosts these projects we have placed under version control. While one aspect of GitHub's service is to host all of these respositories, the main value of GitHub is that it helps developers collaborate more easily. As a developer, GitHub is a great place to look for open source projects to contribute to. GitHub provides great features such as pull requests, bug issue filing and many more that really help teams develop in a more collaborative manner.
